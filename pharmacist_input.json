The Pharmacy is run by a fantastic team, they also have a sizable team of pharmacists on site every day who are continuously on the ball every time I visited or called. Each of them have been superb in their performance and professionalism with me and my family. These people really understand healthcare and the urgency of obtaining what you need quickly when you need it, without making the process complicated or confusing, this is especially important if you are unwell and nervous at the same time. I eventually moved my whole family over to them and now we get all our medications delivered to our home, they are always one call away if I need to quickly reorder, modify something or have them chase something up on my behalf with my GP. It\u2019s great, coming up May 2024 it will be 1 year since I've been using them. Highly recommended! The Pharmacy has free parking right outside the front door and on most occasions, spaces are always available for a quick pick up of your prescription.

A customer in front of me was told similar, and remarked that he had completely run out of his prescribed medication.

Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t fool proof & can occasionally end in my prescription being put back into the NHS system, receiving a bar code & serial number that I can take to a pharmacy to request & collect in person. I explained my situation to the person at the till & was waived off, told they can\u2019t help me & that I should register with them & support local pharmacies. If my circumstances change I\u2019d love to, but I won\u2019t ever step foot in that pharmacy again after seeing how little they care about people if they aren\u2019t registered. After receiving the slight scolding for using a delivery service, I explained that I understood, but for the moment I was low on medication & was focussed on sourcing that before thinking about registering. I was told they couldn\u2019t help me. I explained that the prescription was back in the NHS system & I had the bar code which can be taken to any pharmacy. Frankly, how I receive my prescriptions shouldn\u2019t have factored into it at all, you are allowed to go to a pharmacy with a bar code to collect. They are, of course, allowed to refuse service, but to do this on the basis that I am not registered with them when there is no mention of this as a pre-requisite for collecting prescriptions anywhere seems unfair. After I explained that they physically can help me, if they want to, begrudgingly another member of staff was called over to speak to me. This person understood a little bit more about the system & said they\u2019d go back & see if they could help. After 5 mins I was informed by the original member of staff & a different member of staff, that they didn\u2019t have the stock in & with a smile (quite smugly) told me again that they can\u2019t help me, but if I had been registered with them then they would have been able to do more, & told me again to support them as a local pharmacy. I confirmed that there was nothing they could do to help, & that I\u2019d have to go to another pharmacy, they said yes. Despite knowing they could order in, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to fight it.\nI left this pharmacy and went to a great one in Chertsey (who I also am not registered with). The staff were fab, didn\u2019t have all the stock in but immediately offered to order it for me to pick up the following day, and ensured I had enough medication to be covered until they had the full stock amount.

I am perplexed why when a prescription is sent through to the Pharmacy this is not made up ready for collection? Therefore on my most recent visit, I popped to the Pharmacy a week after my prescription had been sent to be told that it was not ready and that the Pharmacist was on lunch therefore it would be at least another hour before it was ready, I said don't worry I will pop back another day (which is an inconvenience as the Pharmacy had the prescription for week at this point).

The lady behind the counter is always very loyal and says he is stuck in traffic. My suggestion to hrr, and the pharmacist when he finally arrived that perhaps he should aim to get to work at 8.30, giving him 30mins wiggle room and time to login before the chemist opens. The pharmacist's reply to this was \"I will start whatever time I like.\"\n Given that when he does arrive he disappears into the dispensary,  so I cannot see what use his presence is when handing over precriptions!

But not at Tesco pharmacy at Leighton Buzzard.\nI had a prescription for my son for his ADHD medication. On the prescription it is stated that he is prescribed 4 capsules of 10mg medication, thus making it 40 mg per day dosage. At present 10 mg capsules are not available for supply but 40 mg are. My son has been taking it for years and the only reason why the prescription is for 10mg x 4 is because years back her started with 10 mg, which was subsequently increased to 40 mg. His psychiatrist had no idea when issuing the prescription that 10mg dosage will not be available.\nI was at the pharmacy on Saturday evening when most of other places are closed.\nThe pharmacist informed me that 40 mg could not be ordered because their supplier did not have them in stock either. Then his female colleague came over and I asked her whether I could have the prescription and go with it to another pharmacy. She said that it was not possible because the other 2 medications that were mentioned on the prescription have been collected 2 weeks ago. I was surprised about this because on that day I collected medication for a friend of mine at a different pharmacy and they gave me back the prescription for the medication, which they could not supply.\nThen this lady also said that they could not dispense the 40 mg capsules because it was written on the prescription that 4 x 10 mg capsules were prescribed. I noted that even a person with serious maths difficulties would be able to calculate that 10 mg x 4 is 40 mg. I added that I could not go to another pharmacy because it was closed over the weekend and because the actual prescription was with Tesco pharmacy. She again said that she could not give me the prescription because other 2 items on it have been collected already. I pointed that the items that have been collected were ticked of which would clearly indicate to any other pharmacist that there items have been dispensed already. She still said that she could not give me back the prescription. This is the first time that hear this nonsense because all pharmacists in the past returned the prescription to me if they could not supply all of the items.\nShe then went away and brought some print out about guidance on national medication shortage relating to Clarithromycin. I said that this had nothing to do with me, also because at no point did I ask to replace the ADHD medication, but only asked to either give me back the prescription or to order the 40 mg capsules instead of 10 mg x 4. She was talking something about that she 'would not break the rules' because she will risk losing her job. I asked me to show these rules in writing, which she of course could not as no such rules exist. She was also pointing something that the prescription says that 10mg x 4 per se, 112 tablets in total.

Upon arrival and after some initial searching by the staff, I was informed by one of the dispensers that the pharmacy was experiencing supply issues with this medication.\n\nThis information was both surprising and concerning. As a patient, particularly one managing diabetes, timely communication about medication availability is crucial. I inquired why patients were not proactively informed of these supply challenges, as such knowledge would have allowed me to consult with my doctor and seek alternatives before facing an emergency situation. This lack of communication, I pointed out, could potentially endanger patient safety. The response I received was that the pharmacy, due to its busy nature, could not contact individual patients regarding this issue. Consequently, I was advised to contact the emergency helpline 111 as an alternative solution.\n\nWhile this advice may have been technically correct, the manner in which it was delivered left much to be desired. The staff's approach lacked the empathy, concern for patient safety, and professionalism I would expect from medical professionals. Their attitude conveyed a sense of irritation, making me feel more like an inconvenience than a patient in need of assistance. Furthermore, this incident does not appear to be isolated. A review of public forums reveals numerous accounts echoing similar experiences, suggesting a pattern of behavior at Rose Street Pharmacy where patient care seems to be overshadowed by business needs.\n\nIn light of these experiences, I urge Rose Street Pharmacy to consider implementing more effective communication strategies, especially regarding medication shortages. This could include group notifications to affected patients, rather than individual contacts, ensuring that everyone is informed in a timely manner. Improving this aspect of service could greatly enhance patient trust and safety. Additionally, fostering a culture of empathy and professionalism among staff could significantly improve the patient experience at this pharmacy.", "question_type": "nonspecific"}, {"commend_id": 1703552, "comment_text": "have just had my covid and flu jabs at Cadishead Pharmacy.This isn't my normal/local chemist however wasn't too far from my house to get to.\nThe pharmacy had customers when i arrived who were seen to very quickly and efficiently didnt have to wait long to be seen by the assistant who booked me in and went through all the information and checked I was still ok to go ahead with my vaccines  she was very cheerful and checked I had understood everything had to wait a minute for the pharmacist who was going to be doing the vaccinations  he was in-between doing prescriptions and the vaccinations that needed doing  he was very friendly and talked me through what he was doing and checked all the information thoroughly didn't feel my flu or COVID vaccine talked to me to keep me calm and distracted while doing (terrified of needles and causes anxiety) but was over in few minutes he made sure I was ok after each vaccination and that I had all the information and that my record had all been updated electronically and where I could find any information about the vaccinations  felt at ease and made me feel very comfortable would visit chemist again if needed and in that area, very friendly staff a d I even got a sticker for having my vaccinations perfect 5*****", "question_type": "nonspecific"}, {"commend_id": 1703542, "comment_text": "Computer system down for 4-6 months to communicate when scripts ready leaving elderly to make recurrent visits as getting an answer on the phone near impossible.", "question_type": "nonspecific"}, {"commend_id": 1703420, "comment_text": "Really rude staff.

So if you open your parcel and it contains the wrong item, you still have to pay *and* you don't have your prescription. When i told them it was unfair, they said to check the dispatch email. But often that is correct and it's just the item actually in the box that is wrong. I asked customer service what to do, and they said \"that would not happen\".
